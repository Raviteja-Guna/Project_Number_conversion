# Requirements
 The number system is a form of expressing the numbers. In number system conversion, we convert a number of one base to a number of another base. There are a variety of number systems such as binary numbers, decimal numbers, hexadecimal numbers, octal numbers, which can be exercised.
 
 The general representation of number systems are:
Decimal Number – Base 10 – N10
Binary Number – Base 2 – N2
Octal Number – Base 8 – N8
Hexadecimal Number – Base 16 – N16


## Number System Conversion Methods
Number system conversions deal with the operations to change the base of the numbers. For example, to change a decimal number with base 10 to binary number with base 2. We can also perform the arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication on the number system.
